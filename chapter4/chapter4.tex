\chapter{System functionality}
\section{Introduction}
This chapter describes the system architecture, the plan, and the test result. First, the chapter begins with the system architecture which consists of the system functionality and main functions. The system functionality describes the components of the system and the overall structure of the system. The main function section describes all the functions in the system. Lastly, the test plan and the results explain the processes and procedures used for testing the system.

The PlanADay software architecture employs a client-server model, with the frontend handling user interaction through screens and forms, and the backend managing core logic, API integrations, and database operations. The frontend allows users to create plans, customize them, or authenticate via registration and login, sending input to the backend for processing. The backend retrieves data from external APIs like Google Places, caches it for efficient reuse, verifies user credentials using token-based authentication, and stores user data securely. This architecture prioritizes separation of concerns, efficiency through caching, and security, ensuring a scalable and user-friendly system for generating and customizing plans.
