\chapter{System functionality}
\section{Introduction}
This chapter describes the core aspects of the system's functionality, covering its system architecture, primary functions, planning, and testing results that defined the application's capabilities. The first part covers the architecture of the system in this project and the second part covers the main functionality of the system.
\section{System architecture}

\end{figure}
The system will consist of two main components. The first component is frontend, the user-interaction part written as Flutter application which has functionalities of login, using Google OAuth API and has the map preview for user to search for places and navigate through routes. It will have to retrieve raw location data from the device GPS and call to backend using REST API. The second component is backend, which consists of the data manipulation and algorithmic part, which written using Golang. The backend use for retrieve route request from frontend, then All the connections between frontend and backend are proxies trough Cloudflare and internal NGINX reverse proxy. For the backend process, we use MariaDB for relational data store, Neo4j \cite{neo4j} for graph data store, The maps library, Google Maps API and self-hosted OSRM API, is used gather places, routes and any geographic information.

	\label{fig:Welcome screen}
\end{figure}
This figure shows the welcome message and login button, Users can log in by Google to register and log into our application.

	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{chapter4/home_screen.png}
	\caption{Home screen}
	\label{fig:Home screen}
\end{figure}
This figure shows the map, current location, the name the current location after logging in and the user can tap the location icon to update the map screen to show their current location. The user can switch between the home screen and the community screen using the bottom navigation bar below.

\newpage

	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{chapter4/choosing_destination_screen.png}
	\caption{Choosing destination screen}
	\label{fig:Choosing destination screen}
\end{figure}
Users can search routes by specifying both the starting location and the destination to find routes for users.

\newpage
\begin{figure}[!h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{chapter4/choosing_route_screen.png}
	\caption{Choosing route screen}
	\label{fig:Choosing route screen}
\end{figure}
This figure shows the search route results from the starting location to the destination. All routes are sorted by estimated time of arrival by default and users can see multiple routes to go to the destination.

\newpage
\begin{figure}[!h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{chapter4/route_options_screen.png}
	\caption{Route options}
	\label{fig:Route options}
\end{figure}
The recommended routes can be sorted according to the user's preferences, such as the fastest arrival time, the cheapest price, the shortest transfer, and the avoid ferry option. 

\newpage
\begin{figure}[!h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{chapter4/arrival_alert_screen.png}
	\caption{Arrival alert options}
	\label{fig:Arrival alert options}
\end{figure}
There are alerts that can be set when users are nearing the transfer point or the destination which help them reach their destination accurately.

\newpage
\begin{figure}[!h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{chapter4/selected_route_screen.png}
	\caption{Selected route screen}
	\label{fig:Selected route screen}
\end{figure}
Users will see the details of the selected route on the map once they select a route from the search route results. From the starting point to the destination, the route polyline is color-coded separately.

\newpage
\begin{figure}[!h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{chapter4/selected_route_detail_screen.png}
	\caption{Selected route detail screen}
	\label{fig:Selected route detail screen}
\end{figure}
After swiping up the bottom sheet, users will see the details of the selected route including cost, estimated time of arrival, and passed stop of each transport type. Users can tap the Start button for starting to real-time navigation or the Share icon to share the selected route with others.

\newpage
\begin{figure}[!h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{chapter4/real_time_navigation_screen.png}
	\caption{Real-time navigation screen}
	\label{fig:Real-time navigation screen}
\end{figure}
This screen shows the details of the route in real-time including the current location, estimated arrival time, and the navigation overlay showing the current step with time and the next step at the top of the screen.

\newpage
\begin{figure}[!h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{chapter4/share_route_screen.png}
	\caption{Share route screen}
	\label{fig:Share route screen}
\end{figure}
When users tap the Share button, they will receive the generated code and be able to share the code with others without having to search for the route again. 

\newpage
\begin{figure}[!h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{chapter4/community_screen.png}
	\caption{Community screen}
	\label{fig:Community screen}
\end{figure}
This figure shows the suggested places, which are sorted by how often they are searched, and users can search routes based on the code that is generated by others that will navigate them to the shared routes.
