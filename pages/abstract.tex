PlanADay is a mobile application designed to generate personalized one-day trip plans
with minimal effort based on user preferences and input data. The application utilizes two
recommendation strategies: Most-Related Places From Location Area and Based-on-Preferences
Interests. Users can specify details such as their categories of interest (e.g., gyms, parks, cafes,
restaurants, museums, theaters, or art galleries), the starting date and time, preferred location
area, and the number of places to visit. Additionally, PlanADay allows users to view detailed
attraction information, bookmark plans, and access their plan history.

This project demonstrates the practicality of implementing a plan suggestion system by
leveraging user inputs to tailor recommendations. The app provides an intuitive and engaging
experience, enabling users to efficiently discover and plan their ideal day while enhancing
satisfaction and utility.
