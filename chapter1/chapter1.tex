\section{Background}
Due to the large number of people who want to travel to remote areas, whether it be long-distance trips to different provinces or short trips to unfamiliar places, all of them need information for their trips. Especially for public transportation, which is complex and has multiple routes to choose from, some of which may lead to slower trips due to uncertainty in travel time. Despite the current technology such as Google Maps and Apple Maps, they only process the shortest route based on available data, but in some cases, there may be alternative methods of travel that is more convenient and match the user's travel preference, like lowest cost, minimize multi stop, or find the route that has activity along the way. \cite{statistics2017}
