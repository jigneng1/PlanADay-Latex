\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Background}
In today's fast-paced world, people rely more on technology to plan their daily activities and
their free time. However, many planning tools provide general suggestions that may not be
suitable for individual preferences or specific situational requirements such as time, location, or
interest activities. The growing demand for personalized planning in mobile applications gives
an opportunity to create a smart solution that personalizes recommendations to each user's
specific preferences. Users today expect convenience, accuracy, and relevance, especially when
it comes to planning their day or deciding where to go for activities. Personalized services are no
longer an option but rather a requirement for improving user satisfaction and engagement in an
increasingly digital era.
\section{Objectivs}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item To provide the plan which is suitable to the userâ€™s preference.
    \item To provide up-to-date information on opening hours and availability.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Scope}
This project aims to develop a mobile application that suggests one-day trip plans based on user
interests, such as cafes, restaurants, shopping, parks, and more. Users can also provide input,
such as starting location, date and time, and the number of places to visit, to refine the
suggestions and include more relevant locations in their plans. Users of the PlanADay
application
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{can create} personalized one-day trip itineraries based on their interests and preferences.
