\section{Introduction}

\par
Our transportation application aims to enhance user experience by providing seamless navigation from the starting point to the destination. In addition to providing efficient routes, we also offer transparent pricing information, allowing users to select the transportation method that best suits their budget. Our navigator displays the actual cost of each route, enabling users to make informed decisions and pay only for the transportation they use. In addition, we provide the mini social media in the application, users can also share their recent transportation methods to the mini community so that other users can view them.

\end{figure}
\par
In people's everyday life, they need to transport to places for doing things, from daily commute to work, go on a trip or even going abroad. However, there's many concerning and obstacle for transportation. People themselves not able to remember all the routes (i.e., transportation line) that bring him to destination or sometimes there might be more better (in terms of cost, duration, or transfer) transportation route for them that they don't know. These problem may influenced by city plan that have complex arrangements or some localization that might leads to misinformation. As transportation, especially public transportation has a important impact toÂ  people, improving transport information to be more accurate, accessible, and personalized will give an opportunity to people for more ease of life, so all these reasons lead to why we need a better routing application.

\section{Related Research Projects}
\subsection{Google Maps}
This application is designed for regular users who use to find the location of the place, and transportation method between one point to another point, Google Maps allows users to see the detail of the traffic and estimate the time of transporting in each way that user select.

\subsection{Apple Maps}
This application is for Apple users that allows users to find the location, the way to go to their destination, estimate the time of transportation, see the details of traffic, and Apple Maps also provides the bicycle method, so cyclists can use Apple Maps to find the best way to get to their destination by bicycle.

Our Implementation plan is divided into 4 phases that includes:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Proposal Phase} During this initial stage, we engage in discussions to determine and finalize the topic for our project.
	\item \textbf{Document Chapter 1-2} In this phase, we delve into the conceptualization of ideas, feasibilities, conduct research, identify target users, and consult with advisors to gather essential information.
	\item \textbf{Document Chapter 3} This phase is dedicated to the creation of the project document, encompassing the development of diagrams, user personas, and the design of our application's user interface.
	\item \textbf{Project Implementation} The final phase involves a concentrated effort on coding, testing, and deploying our application.
